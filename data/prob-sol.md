 The assumption that all vertices of the icosahedron correspond to vectors of the same length forces the center
of the icosahedron to lie at the origin, since the icosahedron is inscribed in a unique sphere. Since scaling
the icosahedron does not change whether or not the
stated conclusion is true, we may choose coordinates so
that the vertices are the cyclic permutations of the vectors (±

is the golden ratio.
The subgroup of R
3 generated by these vectors contains
G×G×G where G is the subgroup of R generated by
1 and φ. Since φ is irrational, it generates a dense subgroup of R/Z; hence G is dense in R, and so G×G×G
is dense in R
